# Storage Services Module

## Overview
This module provides a unified, secure, and extensible abstraction for all file and object storage needs in the Spotify AI Agent platform. It supports local, S3-compatible, and CDN storage, with advanced features for security, audit, and industrial-grade scalability.

### Key Features
- Unified interface for file/object storage (local, S3, CDN)
- Secure upload/download, access control, encryption, virus scanning
- Versioning, audit logging, retention policies
- ML/AI hooks for content analysis (e.g. audio/image moderation)
- Scalable, production-ready, cloud-native
- Full compliance (GDPR, audit, access logs)

### Structure
- `file_service.py`: Abstract base class, interface, and business logic
- `local_storage_service.py`: Local filesystem storage (secure, for dev/test)
- `s3_service.py`: S3-compatible object storage (AWS, MinIO, etc.)
- `cdn_service.py`: CDN integration (CloudFront, Cloudflare, etc.)

### Usage Example
```python
from .s3_service import S3StorageService
s3 = S3StorageService(bucket="my-bucket", region="eu-west-1")
url = s3.upload_file("/tmp/song.mp3", key="audio/2025/song.mp3")
```

### Security & Compliance
- All operations are logged and auditable
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Access control, signed URLs, virus scanning
- GDPR-compliant deletion and retention

### Extensibility
- Add new storage backends by extending `FileStorageService`
- ML/AI hooks for content analysis, moderation, or indexing
