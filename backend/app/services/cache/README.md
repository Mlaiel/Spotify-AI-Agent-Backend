## Overview
A production-grade, multi-backend, secure, observable, and extensible cache system for AI, analytics, and Spotify data workflows.

## Features
- Multi-backend: Redis, in-memory, pluggable
- Advanced strategies: LRU, LFU, ML-based adaptive
- Security: Encryption, RBAC, audit, cache poisoning protection
- Observability: Prometheus metrics, logging, tracing
- Business logic: Pre-warming, invalidation hooks, partitioning, fallback
- Industrial-grade: Pooling, Lua scripts, failover, clustering

## Architecture
```
[API/Service] <-> [CacheManager] <-> [CacheStrategy] <-> [Backend: Redis/Memory]
                                 |-> [Security]
                                 |-> [Metrics]
                                 |-> [InvalidationService]
```

## Usage Example
```python
from services.cache import CacheManager
cache = CacheManager(backend="redis")
cache.set("spotify:user:123", {"top_tracks": [...]}, ttl=3600)
data = cache.get("spotify:user:123")
cache.invalidate("spotify:user:123")
```

## Security
- All cache values are encrypted (Fernet/AES)
- RBAC and audit hooks available
- Supports secure Redis connections (TLS, password)

## Observability
- Prometheus metrics: hits, misses, sets
- Logging: all operations, security events
- Tracing: integration-ready

## Advanced Hooks
- Register invalidation hooks for real-time sync
- Pre-warm cache with business-critical data

## Best Practices
- Use short TTL for volatile data
- Partition cache by business domain
- Monitor metrics and set up alerts
