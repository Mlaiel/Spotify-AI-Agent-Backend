## Overview
A production-grade, secure, observable, and extensible queue system for AI, analytics, and Spotify data workflows.

## Features
- Distributed task queue (Redis, RabbitMQ, Celery, custom)
- Job processing (async, retry, priority, scheduling)
- Event publishing (pub/sub, hooks, audit)
- Advanced scheduler (cron, interval, delayed jobs)
- Security: audit, encryption, anti-abuse, logging
- Observability: metrics, logs, tracing
- Business logic: workflow orchestration, batch processing, real-time events

## Architecture
```
[API/Service] <-> [TaskQueueService]
    |-> JobProcessor
    |-> SchedulerService
    |-> EventPublisher
```

## Usage Example
```python
from services.queue import TaskQueueService, JobProcessor, SchedulerService, EventPublisher
queue = TaskQueueService()
queue.enqueue("send_email", {"to": "user@example.com"})
```

## Security
- All jobs and events are logged and auditable
- Supports encrypted queues and anti-abuse logic
- Rate limiting and priority queues

## Observability
- Prometheus metrics: enqueued, processed, failed, scheduled
- Logging: all operations, security events
- Tracing: integration-ready

## Best Practices
- Use priority queues for critical jobs
- Monitor queue metrics and set up alerts
- Partition queues by business domain
