# Spotify Services Module

## Overview
This module centralizes all advanced business logic and integrations for Spotify data, analytics, and automation. It is designed for industrial, production-grade use in AI-powered artist platforms.

### Key Features
- Secure, robust integration with Spotify API (OAuth2, rate limiting, retry, caching)
- Advanced artist insights (audience, trends, ML-based clustering, scoring)
- Intelligent playlist management (AI recommendations, analytics, ML integration)
- Real-time streaming monitoring (anomaly detection, webhooks, secure storage)
- Deep track analysis (audio features, ML mood/BPM, plagiarism detection)
- User data profiling (segmentation, GDPR, anonymization, multi-source sync)
- Full security (token management, validation, logging, audit, rate limiting)

### Structure
- `spotify_api_service.py`: Secure API integration, token management, error handling
- `artist_insights_service.py`: Audience analytics, ML clustering, trend detection
- `playlist_service.py`: Playlist creation, AI recommendations, performance analytics
- `streaming_service.py`: Real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, webhooks
- `track_analysis_service.py`: Audio feature extraction, ML analysis, optimization
- `user_data_service.py`: Profiling, segmentation, GDPR, data sync

### Usage Example
```python
from .spotify_api_service import SpotifyAPIService
from .artist_insights_service import ArtistInsightsService

api = SpotifyAPIService(client_id, client_secret)
artist_service = ArtistInsightsService(api)
insights = artist_service.get_artist_audience_insights(artist_id)
```

### Security & Compliance
- All endpoints and data flows are secured (OAuth2, input validation, logging)
- GDPR-compliant user data handling
- Rate limiting and monitoring included

### Extensibility
- Each service is modular, testable, and ready for production
- ML hooks for custom models (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face)
- Easy integration with other microservices
