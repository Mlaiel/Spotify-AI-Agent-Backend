## Overview
A production-grade, secure, analytics-ready, and extensible email system for AI, analytics, and Spotify data workflows.

## Features
- SMTP integration (TLS, OAuth, failover)
- Advanced templating (Jinja2, multilingual, dynamic)
- Email analytics (open/click tracking, deliverability, ML scoring)
- Security: encryption, anti-abuse, audit, logging
- Observability: metrics, logs, tracing
- Business logic: campaign management, notifications, transactional emails

## Architecture
```
[API/Service] <-> [EmailService]
    |-> SMTPService
    |-> TemplateService
    |-> EmailAnalytics
```

## Usage Example
```python
from services.email import EmailService
email = EmailService()
email.send_mail(
    to=["user@example.com"],
    subject="Welcome!",
    template_name="welcome.html",
    context={"user": "Alice"}
)
```

## Security
- All emails are logged and auditable

- Anti-abuse and rate limiting

## Observability
- Prometheus metrics: sent, failed, opened, clicked
- Logging: all operations, security events
- Tracing: integration-ready

## Best Practices

- Monitor analytics and set up alerts
- Partition campaigns by business domain
