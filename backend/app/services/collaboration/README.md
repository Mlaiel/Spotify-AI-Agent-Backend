## Overview
A production-grade, secure, real-time, and extensible collaboration system for AI, analytics, and Spotify data workflows.

## Features
- Real-time collaboration (WebSocket, pub/sub, event-driven)
- Advanced permissions & RBAC
- Notification system (in-app, email, push)
- Version control for collaborative objects
- Workspace management (multi-tenant, isolation, audit)
- Security: audit, encryption, anti-abuse, logging
- Observability: metrics, logs, tracing

## Architecture
```
[API/Service] <-> [Collaboration Services]
    |-> NotificationService
    |-> PermissionService
    |-> RealTimeService
    |-> VersionControlService
    |-> WorkspaceService
```

## Usage Example
```python
from services.collaboration import NotificationService, PermissionService, RealTimeService, VersionControlService, WorkspaceService
notif = NotificationService()
notif.send("user:123", "You have a new collaboration invite!")
perm = PermissionService()
perm.check_permission("user:123", "workspace:42", "edit")
```

## Security
- All actions are audited
- RBAC and anti-abuse logic
- Secure WebSocket and API endpoints

## Observability
- Prometheus metrics: events, errors, latency
- Logging: all operations, security events
- Tracing: integration-ready

## Best Practices
- Use granular permissions for sensitive actions
- Monitor collaboration events and set up alerts
- Partition workspaces by business domain
