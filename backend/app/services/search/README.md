## Overview
A production-grade, secure, observable, and extensible search system for AI, analytics, and Spotify data workflows.

## Features
- Full-text, faceted, and semantic search (Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, custom)
- Advanced indexing (real-time, batch, incremental)
- Semantic search (embeddings, ML/NLP, vector DB)
- Security: audit, access control, anti-abuse, logging
- Observability: metrics, logs, tracing
- Business logic: personalized ranking, recommendations, analytics

## Architecture
```
[API/Service] <-> [SearchService]
    |-> IndexingService
    |-> FacetedSearchService
    |-> SemanticSearchService
```

## Usage Example
```python
from services.search import SearchService, IndexingService, FacetedSearchService, SemanticSearchService
search = SearchService()
results = search.query("top playlists AI")
```

## Security
- All queries and indexing are logged and auditable
- Supports access control and anti-abuse logic
- Rate limiting and query partitioning

## Observability
- Prometheus metrics: queries, latency, errors
- Logging: all operations, security events
- Tracing: integration-ready

## Best Practices
- Use semantic search for personalized results
- Monitor search metrics and set up alerts
- Partition indices by business domain
