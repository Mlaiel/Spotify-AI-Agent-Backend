# Documentation (EN)

## Overview
This module provides advanced, production-ready Pydantic schemas for all API request/response objects in the Spotify AI Agent backend. All schemas are:
- Fully validated, business-aligned, and ready for enterprise use
- DSGVO/GDPR & HIPAA compliant (privacy, consent, audit, data minimization)
- Security-first: password policy, email validation, traceability, multi-tenancy, audit, explainability, logging, monitoring
- No TODOs, no placeholders, 100% production-ready

## Features
- **Consent & Privacy**: All endpoints require explicit user consent (DSGVO Art. 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 17, 20, 21)
- **Audit & Traceability**: All requests/responses support audit logs, trace IDs, and compliance flags
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Tenant-ID support for SaaS/Enterprise
- **Explainability**: Explainability fields for AI endpoints
- **Soft-Delete**: All delete operations are soft and auditable
- **Versioning**: All schemas support versioning for API evolution
- **Security**: Passwords, emails, and sensitive data are validated and never logged
