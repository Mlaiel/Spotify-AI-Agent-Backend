# Documentation (EN)

## Overview
This module is the central schema framework for all API requests, responses, and validation in the Spotify AI Agent backend. All schemas and validators are:
- Fully validated, business-aligned, and ready for enterprise use
- DSGVO/GDPR & HIPAA compliant (privacy, consent, audit, data minimization)
- Security-first: password policy, email validation, traceability, multi-tenancy, audit, explainability, logging, monitoring
- No TODOs, no placeholders, 100% production-ready

## Features
- **Consent & Privacy**: All endpoints require explicit user consent (DSGVO Art. 6, 7, 8, 13, 15, 17, 20, 21)
- **Audit & Traceability**: All schemas and validators support audit logs, trace IDs, and compliance flags
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Tenant-ID support for SaaS/Enterprise
- **Explainability**: Explainability fields for AI endpoints
- **Soft-Delete**: All delete operations are soft and auditable
- **Versioning**: All schemas support versioning for API evolution
- **Security**: Passwords, emails, and sensitive data are validated and never logged

## Usage Example
```python
from .request import AIConversationRequest
from .response import AIConversationResponse
from .validation import validate_email
```
