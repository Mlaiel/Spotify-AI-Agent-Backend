## Structure
- One folder per language (ISO): en, fr, de, es, it, etc.
- Files: api_responses.json, errors.json, messages.json, system.json, validation.json

- Ready for multilingual QA, automatic fallback, pluralization, cultural contexts
- Automated audit scripts for coverage & consistency
- CLI tools for import/export, batch translation, and validation

## Integration Hooks

# Example loading a localized message
import json
with open('locales/en/messages.json') as f:
    messages = json.load(f)
print(messages["welcome"])
```
