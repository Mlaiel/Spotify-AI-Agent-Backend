## Purpose
This module centralizes all enums used across the backend for strict typing, validation, business logic clarity, security, and compliance. Enums are grouped by domain: AI, Collaboration, Spotify, System, User, Security.

## Best Practices
- All enums are Python 3.11+ `Enum` or `StrEnum` for type safety and serialization.
- Each enum is documented and ready for direct business use (no TODOs).
- Extend enums only via PR and with business justification.
- Security, audit, and compliance enums included for enterprise readiness.

## Files
- `ai_enums.py` – AI task types, model types, pipeline stages, training status, feature flags
- `collaboration_enums.py` – Collaboration status, request types, roles, feedback, matching
- `spotify_enums.py` – Spotify entity types, playlist status, audio features, market, release type
- `system_enums.py` – System status, environment, log levels, error codes, feature flags, API version
- `user_enums.py` – User roles, account status, permissions, subscription, MFA, consent, notification, device

---

## Usage Example
```python
from enums.spotify_enums import SpotifyEntityType
entity = SpotifyEntityType.TRACK
```

## Security & Governance
- All enums are peer-reviewed and versioned
- Security and compliance enums are included for audit and GDPR/DSGVO
- Enum changes require business and security review
