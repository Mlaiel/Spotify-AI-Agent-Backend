# Spotify AI Agent â€“ Tasks Module

## Overview
This module orchestrates all distributed, production-grade tasks for the Spotify AI Agent backend. It unifies business, AI/ML, analytics, maintenance, and orchestration tasks under a secure, observable, and extensible architecture.

### Key Features
- **Celery Orchestration**: Robust, secure, and scalable task execution (see `celery/`)
- **Spotify Business Tasks**: Artist monitoring, playlist updates, streaming analytics, content generation (see `spotify_tasks/`)
- **AI/ML Tasks**: Audio analysis, model training, recommendation updates (see `ai_tasks/`)
- **Analytics Tasks**: Data aggregation, reporting, trend detection (see `analytics_tasks/`)
- **Maintenance Tasks**: Backups, health checks, GDPR cleanup, log rotation (see `maintenance_tasks/`)
- **Observability**: Integrated Prometheus/OpenTelemetry metrics, Sentry/PagerDuty alerting, audit logging
- **Security**: Input validation, traceability, compliance, secrets management
- **Extensibility**: Add new business, ML, or infra tasks as Python modules with Celery decorators

### Architecture
- **/celery/**: Task infrastructure, app factory, config, registry, monitoring
- **/spotify_tasks/**: Spotify business logic tasks
- **/ai_tasks/**: ML/AI-powered tasks
- **/analytics_tasks/**: Analytics and reporting
- **/maintenance_tasks/**: System maintenance, compliance, health

### Best Practices
