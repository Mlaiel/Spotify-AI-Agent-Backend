# Spotify Tasks Module

## Overview
This module provides advanced, production-ready Spotify-related task orchestration for the Spotify AI Agent platform. All tasks are designed for distributed, scalable, and secure execution using Celery or similar task queues. Each task is:
- Fully validated, business-aligned, and ready for enterprise use
- Security-first: input validation, audit logging, traceability, monitoring
- Observability: logs, metrics, error handling, retries, alerting
- Prometheus/OpenTelemetry metrics and tracing, Sentry/PagerDuty alerting
- No TODOs, no placeholders, 100% production-ready

### Key Features
- **Artist Monitoring**: Real-time and scheduled monitoring of artist stats, trends, and alerts
- **Data Sync**: Secure, incremental, and auditable synchronization with Spotify APIs
- **Playlist Update**: Automated, AI-driven playlist curation and update
- **Streaming Metrics**: Real-time and batch collection, aggregation, and anomaly detection
- **Track Analysis**: Deep audio feature extraction, ML-based analysis, and reporting
- **Social Media Sync**: Cross-platform social data integration and mapping
- **AI Content Generation**: Automated, ML/AI-powered content creation for artists

### Usage Example
```python
from .artist_monitoring import monitor_artist
from .data_sync import sync_artist_data
from .social_media_sync import sync_social_media
from .ai_content_generation import generate_content
```

### Best Practices
- All tasks are idempotent, auditable, and support retries
- All inputs/outputs are validated and logged securely
- All tasks support trace IDs and metrics for observability
- All Spotify tasks are versioned and explainable
- Prometheus/OpenTelemetry metrics and Sentry/PagerDuty alerting integrated

### Extensibility
- Add new tasks as Python modules with Celery decorators and full docstrings
- Integrate with monitoring (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry), alerting (Sentry, PagerDuty), and audit systems
