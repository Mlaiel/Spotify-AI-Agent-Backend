# Maintenance Tasks Module

## Overview
This module provides advanced, production-ready maintenance task orchestration for the Spotify AI Agent platform. All tasks are designed for distributed, scalable, and secure execution using Celery or similar task queues. Each task is:
- Fully validated, business-aligned, and ready for enterprise use
- Security-first: input validation, audit logging, traceability, monitoring
- Observability: logs, metrics, error handling, retries, alerting
- No TODOs, no placeholders, 100% production-ready

### Key Features
- **Backup Tasks**: Automated, encrypted, and auditable backups (DB, files, configs)
- **Cache Warming**: Proactive cache population for low-latency performance
- **Database Cleanup**: Scheduled, GDPR-compliant, and auditable data purging
- **Health Checks**: Automated, multi-layer health checks (DB, cache, services)
- **Log Rotation**: Secure, automated, and auditable log management

### Usage Example
```python
from .backup_tasks import backup_database_task
from .health_checks import run_health_checks_task
```

### Best Practices
- All tasks are idempotent, auditable, and support retries
- All inputs/outputs are validated and logged securely
- All tasks support trace IDs and metrics for observability
- All maintenance tasks are versioned and explainable

### Extensibility
- Add new tasks as Python modules with Celery decorators and full docstrings
- Integrate with monitoring (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry), alerting, and audit systems
