# Celery Orchestration Module

## Overview
This module provides advanced, production-ready Celery orchestration for the Spotify AI Agent platform. It includes robust configuration, dynamic task registration, worker monitoring, and security best practices for distributed, scalable, and secure task execution.

### Key Features
- **Celery App**: Centralized, extensible Celery application factory
- **Configuration**: Secure, environment-driven, production-ready settings
- **Task Registry**: Dynamic, auto-discovered, auditable task registration
- **Worker Monitoring**: Health checks, metrics, alerting, auto-restart
- **Security**: Input validation, audit logging, traceability, secrets management
- **Observability**: Logging, tracing, metrics, error handling, retries, alerting

### Usage Example
```python
from .celery_app import celery_app
from .task_registry import register_all_tasks
```

### Best Practices
- All tasks and workers are auditable, monitored, and support retries
- All configuration is environment-driven and secrets are never hardcoded
- All task registration is dynamic and supports versioning
- All monitoring is integrated with Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, or similar

### Extensibility
- Add new tasks and modules with automatic registration and monitoring
- Integrate with external monitoring, alerting, and audit systems
