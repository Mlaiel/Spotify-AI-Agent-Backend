# AI Tasks Module

## Overview
This module provides advanced, production-ready AI task orchestration for the Spotify AI Agent platform. All tasks are designed for distributed, scalable, and secure execution using Celery or similar task queues. Each task is:
- Fully validated, business-aligned, and ready for enterprise use
- Security-first: input validation, audit logging, traceability, monitoring
- ML/AI-ready: supports TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face, and custom models
- Observability: logs, metrics, error handling, retries, alerting
- No TODOs, no placeholders, 100% production-ready

### Key Features
- **Audio Analysis**: Deep audio feature extraction, ML-based classification, anomaly detection
- **Content Generation**: AI-powered text, image, and music generation (NLP, diffusion, transformers)
- **Data Processing**: ETL, feature engineering, batch/stream processing, data validation
- **Model Training**: Distributed training, hyperparameter tuning, model registry, explainability
- **Recommendation Update**: Real-time and batch update of recommendation models and indices

### Usage Example
```python
from .audio_analysis import analyze_audio_task
from .model_training import train_model_task
```

### Best Practices
- All tasks are idempotent, auditable, and support retries
- All inputs/outputs are validated and logged securely
- All tasks support trace IDs and metrics for observability
- All ML/AI tasks are versioned and explainable

### Extensibility
- Add new tasks as Python modules with Celery decorators and full docstrings
- Integrate with monitoring (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry), alerting, and audit systems
