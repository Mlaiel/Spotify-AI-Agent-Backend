## Usage

### Basic User Creation

```python
from user import UserManager, UserTier

# Initialize user manager
user_manager = UserManager()

# Create a premium user
profile = await user_manager.create_user(
    email="user@example.com",
    password="secure_password",
    tier=UserTier.PREMIUM,
    profile_data={
        "display_name": "John Doe",
        "language": "en",
        "timezone": "UTC"
    }
)
```

### Authentication

```python
# Authenticate user
authenticated_user = await user_manager.authenticate_user(
    email="user@example.com",
    password="secure_password",
    context={
        "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
        "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
        "device_id": "device_123"
    }
)
```

### Profile Management

```python
# Update user profile
updated_profile = await user_manager.update_user_profile(
    user_id="user_123",
    updates={
        "display_name": "Jane Doe",
        "ai_preferences": {
            "personalization_level": "advanced",
            "mood_detection_enabled": True
        }
    }
)

# Upgrade user tier
upgraded_profile = await user_manager.upgrade_user_tier(
    user_id="user_123",
    new_tier=UserTier.ENTERPRISE
)
```

### Analytics

```python
# Get user insights
insights = await user_manager.get_user_insights("user_123")
```

ai_preferences = AIPreferences(
    personalization_level=AIPersonalizationLevel.ADVANCED,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    custom_model_training=True,
    bias_mitigation_enabled=True
)
```
