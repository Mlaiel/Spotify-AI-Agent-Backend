# Kubernetes Manifests for Development Environment
===============================================

## Overview

This module contains all Kubernetes manifests for the development environment of the multi-tenant Spotify AI Agent system.

**Developed by:** Fahed Mlaiel and his expert team

### Team Composition:
- **Lead Dev + AI Architect:** Fahed Mlaiel - System architecture and AI integration
- **Senior Backend Developer:** Python/FastAPI/Django development
- **Machine Learning Engineer:** TensorFlow/PyTorch/Hugging Face implementation
- **DBA & Data Engineer:** PostgreSQL/Redis/MongoDB optimization
- **Backend Security Specialist:** Security policies and compliance
- **Microservices Architect:** Service design and orchestration

## Architecture

### Components:
- **Deployments:** Application deployments
- **Services:** Kubernetes services
- **ConfigMaps:** Configuration management
- **Secrets:** Sensitive data
- **PersistentVolumes:** Storage solutions
- **NetworkPolicies:** Network security
- **RBAC:** Role-based access control
- **HPA:** Horizontal pod autoscaling
- **Ingress:** External exposition

### Directory Structure:
```
manifests/
├── deployments/          # Application deployments
├── services/            # Kubernetes services
├── configs/            # ConfigMaps and configurations
├── secrets/            # Secret configurations
├── storage/            # Persistent volumes
├── networking/         # Network policies and ingress
├── security/           # RBAC and security policies
├── monitoring/         # Metrics and observability
├── autoscaling/        # Auto-scaling configurations
└── jobs/              # Jobs and CronJobs
```

## Usage

### Deployment:
```bash
# Apply all manifests
kubectl apply -f manifests/

# Deploy specific module
kubectl apply -f manifests/deployments/
```

### Monitoring:
```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n spotify-ai-agent-dev

# View logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/spotify-ai-agent -n spotify-ai-agent-dev
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables:
- `NAMESPACE`: Kubernetes namespace (default: spotify-ai-agent-dev)
- `REPLICAS`: Number of pod replicas
- `RESOURCES_LIMITS`: Resource limits for pods

### Labels:
All manifests use standardized labels for consistent identification and management.

## Security

- All manifests implement Kubernetes security best practices
- RBAC policies for minimal permissions
- NetworkPolicies for network isolation
- Pod Security Standards compliance

## Scaling

The system supports horizontal autoscaling based on:
- CPU utilization
- Memory consumption
- Custom metrics

## Monitoring and Logging

Integration with:
- Prometheus for metrics
- Grafana for dashboards
- ELK Stack for logging
- Jaeger for distributed tracing

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy:
- Unit tests for manifest generation logic
- Integration tests for Kubernetes deployment
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Performance tests for scalability validation

### Validation:
- Manifest syntax validation
- Resource requirement validation
- Security policy compliance checks
- Performance benchmarking

## Development Workflow

### Local Development:
1. Use kind or minikube for local Kubernetes cluster
2. Apply development manifests
3. Test changes with realistic data sets
4. Validate performance and security

### CI/CD Integration:
- Automated manifest validation
- Security scanning
- Performance testing
- Automated deployment to staging
