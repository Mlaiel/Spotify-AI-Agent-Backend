## Purpose
This directory contains all Alembic migration scripts for the PostgreSQL database schema. It ensures versioned, auditable, and reversible schema changes for the Spotify AI Agent backend.

## Best Practices
- All migrations are atomic, idempotent, and fully reversible.
- Each migration script is named with a timestamp and a clear description.
- Use `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"` for new migrations.
- Review and test every migration in staging before production.
- All migrations are peer-reviewed and tracked in CI/CD.
- Security, audit, analytics, partitioning, and compliance logic are included for enterprise readiness.
- Use advanced features: partitioning, triggers, constraints, audit logging, rollback, masking sensitive data in logs.

## Usage
```bash
# Create a new migration
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add new table"
# Apply migrations
alembic upgrade head
# Downgrade (if needed)
alembic downgrade -1
```

## Directory Structure
- `versions/` : All migration scripts (one file per schema change)
- `env.py`, `script.py.mako` : Alembic environment, templates, advanced logging, audit, security
