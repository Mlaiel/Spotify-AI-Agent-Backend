## Purpose
This directory contains all versioned PostgreSQL migration scripts for schema, tables, business logic, security, audit, compliance, automation, and advanced enterprise features. All scripts are production-ready, business-aligned, and CI/CD-integrated.

## Scripts Overview
- `001_initial_schema.py` – Create base schema, user and artist tables
- `002_add_spotify_tables.py` – Add Spotify data tables (tracks, albums, playlists)
- `003_add_ai_tables.py` – Add AI content, recommendation, ML logs, versioning, security
- `004_add_collaboration_tables.py` – Add collaboration, matching, roles, history, security
- `005_add_analytics_tables.py` – Add analytics, event logs, audit, security
- `006_rollback.py` – Rollback/undo for analytics, audit, security
- `007_partitioning.py` – Partitioning for large tables (e.g. analytics)
- `008_bulk_import_export.py` – Bulk import/export for analytics, audit, user
- `009_health_check.py` – Health-check and integrity for all core tables
- `010_gdpr_erasure.py` – GDPR-compliant user data erasure/anonymization
- `011_zero_downtime_migration.py` – Zero-downtime migration pattern (shadow tables, dual writes)

> **Note:** All scripts are atomic, idempotent, reversible, CI/CD-tested, and support audit logging.

## Advanced Features & Best Practices
- **Security:**
  - Audit, logs, access control, GDPR anonymization, rollback, anomaly triggers
- **Compliance:**
  - GDPR, SOC2, ISO 27001, audit trails, consent management, automated erasure
- **Automation:**
  - CI/CD-ready, auto-discovery, dry-run, audit, health-check, bulk import/export, partitioning, zero-downtime
- **Business Logic:**
  - All migrations align with Spotify AI Agent business requirements
  - Support for multilingual, geo, AI/ML, analytics, versioning
- **Governance:**
  - All changes are tracked, versioned, and auditable
  - Usage policies and extension guidelines included

## Usage Examples
### Run All Migrations (Core & Advanced)
```bash
alembic upgrade head
# or
python 001_initial_schema.py
```

### Run a single migration manually
```bash
python 007_partitioning.py
```

### Bulk Import/Export
```python
from 008_bulk_import_export import bulk_import, bulk_export
bulk_import('analytics', 'analytics.csv')
bulk_export('users', 'users.csv')
```

### Health-Check
```python
from 009_health_check import check_health
check_health()
```

### GDPR Erasure
```python
from 010_gdpr_erasure import erase_user
erase_user(user_id=123)
```

### Zero-Downtime Migration
```python
from 011_zero_downtime_migration import upgrade
upgrade()
```

### Rollback
```bash
python 006_rollback.py
```

## Governance & Extension
- All scripts must be reviewed and approved by the Core Team
- New scripts must follow naming/versioning conventions and include docstrings
- Security and compliance checks are mandatory for all migrations

## Contact
For changes, incidents, or questions, contact the Core Team via Slack #spotify-ai-agent or GitHub. For security/compliance, escalate to the Security Officer.
