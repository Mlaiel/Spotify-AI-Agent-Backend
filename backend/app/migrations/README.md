## Purpose
This module orchestrates all database and search migrations for the Spotify AI Agent backend. It covers PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Alembic, with advanced automation, security, compliance, and business logic.

## Structure
- `postgresql/` : All PostgreSQL migration scripts (schema, tables, business logic, rollback, partitioning, bulk, GDPR, zero-downtime)
- `mongodb/` : All MongoDB migration scripts (collections, indexes, advanced, rollback, partitioning, bulk, GDPR, zero-downtime)
- `elasticsearch/` : All Elasticsearch mappings, scripts, and automation (mappings, reindex, health-check, audit, multilingual, geo, AI)
- `alembic/` : Alembic configuration, templates, and advanced migration runners
- `__init__.py` : Auto-discovery, governance, security, and helper functions for automation

## Advanced Features & Best Practices
- All scripts are atomic, idempotent, reversible, and CI/CD-ready
- Security: audit, logs, access control, GDPR/DSGVO anonymization, rollback, compliance checks
- Compliance: GDPR, SOC2, ISO 27001, audit trails, consent management, automated erasure
- Automation: auto-discovery, dry-run, audit, health-check, bulk import/export, partitioning, zero-downtime
- Multilingual, geo, AI/ML, analytics, versioning, and business logic support
- All changes are tested in staging before production

## Usage Example
### Run All Migrations (Core & Advanced)
```bash
cd postgresql && alembic upgrade head
cd ../mongodb && python migrate.py --env=production
cd ../elasticsearch/scripts && python create_all_indexes.py
```

### Health-Check
```bash
cd postgresql/versions && python 009_health_check.py
cd ../mongodb/migrations && mongo < health_check.js
cd ../../elasticsearch/scripts && python validate_mappings.py
```

### GDPR/DSGVO Erasure
```bash
cd postgresql/versions && python 010_gdpr_erasure.py
cd ../mongodb/migrations && mongo < gdpr_erasure.js --eval 'var userId="..."'
```

### Zero-Downtime Migration
```bash
cd postgresql/versions && python 011_zero_downtime_migration.py
cd ../mongodb/migrations && mongo < zero_downtime_migration.js
```

## Governance & Extension
- All scripts must be reviewed and approved by the Core Team
- New scripts must follow naming/versioning conventions and include docstrings
- Security and compliance checks are mandatory for all migrations

## Contact
For changes, incidents, or questions, contact the Core Team via Slack #spotify-ai-agent or GitHub. For security/compliance, escalate to the Security Officer.
