# AI ORM Models Documentation (EN)

**Spotify AI Agent â€“ Enterprise-Grade ORM for AI**

## Purpose
This module provides all advanced, production-ready ORM models for AI features:
- AI Conversations (chat, prompt, context, user attribution, multi-tenancy)
- Feedback & Ratings (user, model, audit, explainability)
- Generated Content (text, audio, metadata, versioning, traceability)
- Model Config (hyperparameters, registry, version, audit, security)
- Model Performance (accuracy, fairness, drift, monitoring, logging)
- Training Data (lineage, source, compliance, audit, data quality)

## Features
- Full validation, security, audit, soft-delete, timestamps, user attribution, multi-tenancy
- CI/CD-ready, governance, compliance, logging, explainability, monitoring, data lineage
- Extendable for new AI models, pipelines, integrations
- Optimized for PostgreSQL, MongoDB, hybrid architectures

## Best Practices
- All models are reviewed and approved by the Core Team
- Security and compliance checks are mandatory
- Usage is logged for audit and traceability

## Usage Example
```python
from .ai_conversation import AIConversation
conv = AIConversation.create(user_id=1, prompt="Hello", response="Hi!", model_name="gpt-4")
```

## Governance & Extension
- All changes must follow naming/versioning conventions and include docstrings
- Security, audit, and compliance are enforced at all levels
