# ORM Root Documentation (EN)

**Spotify AI Agent â€“ Enterprise-Grade ORM Root**

## Purpose
This package provides all base classes, mixins, and governance for advanced, production-ready ORM models:
- Base classes for validation, security, audit, soft-delete, timestamps, multi-tenancy, data lineage
- Mixins for versioning, traceability, compliance, logging, user attribution, explainability
- Governance, extension policy, security, compliance, CI/CD, data lineage

All submodules (ai, analytics, collaboration, spotify, users) are optimized for PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and hybrid architectures.

## Best Practices
- All models inherit from BaseModel and use relevant mixins
- Security, audit, and compliance are enforced at all levels
- Usage is logged for audit and traceability

## Usage Example
```python
from .base_model import BaseModel
class MyModel(BaseModel):
    ...
```

## Governance & Extension
- All changes must follow naming/versioning conventions and include docstrings
- Security, audit, and compliance are enforced at all levels
