# Advanced WebSocket Services

This folder contains industrial-grade services for scalability, audit, analytics, and AI in the WebSocket module:

- **redis_pubsub.py**: Redis Pub/Sub for inter-instance broadcast (scalability, high availability)
- **postgres_audit.py**: PostgreSQL audit for all sensitive actions (connection, message, error)
- **mongodb_events.py**: Storage of WebSocket events for analytics, logs, GDPR compliance
- **ai_moderation.py**: AI moderation service (Hugging Face, custom API) to filter messages

## Architecture Recommendations
- Use Redis for broadcast and state synchronization between instances (cloud-native scalability)
- Centralize audit in PostgreSQL for compliance and traceability
- Store analytics events in MongoDB for real-time analytics
- Connect AI moderation to a Hugging Face microservice or custom model (TensorFlow/PyTorch)

## Integration Examples
```python
from services import RedisPubSub, PostgresAuditService, MongoDBEventsService, AIModerationService

redis = RedisPubSub(redis_url="redis://localhost:6379/0")
audit = PostgresAuditService(dsn="postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db")
mongo = MongoDBEventsService(mongo_url="mongodb://localhost:27017")
ai = AIModerationService(api_url="https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/xxx")
```

## Security & Compliance
- Restrict access to databases (firewall, VPN, strong credentials)
- Log and audit all critical actions
- Anonymize sensitive data for GDPR compliance

## Extensibility
- Add other services (Kafka, BigQuery, etc.) as needed
- Connect audit to a SIEM or data lake
