## Mission
Guarantee that every logging configuration is:
- Complete and validated for all required loggers and handlers
- Secure (no plain secrets, correct permissions, no weak values)
- Compatible with all deployment stages (dev, staging, prod, test)
- Ready for CI/CD, containerization, and cloud deployment
- Audited for compliance and best practices

## What is tested?
- Logger presence, handler types, and formatter configuration
- Security (no weak/default secrets, no passwords in plain text)
- Permissions (readable only by owner)
- Integration with monitoring, alerting, and tracing
- Compatibility with Python logging, Gunicorn, Nginx, and cloud logging solutions
