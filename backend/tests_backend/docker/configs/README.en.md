# Advanced Industrial Docker Config Tests

This directory contains advanced, industrial-grade tests for Docker scripts and configuration files used in application orchestration. All tests are designed and maintained by a multidisciplinary expert team:

✅ Senior Backend Developer (Python/FastAPI/Django)
✅ Machine Learning Engineer (TensorFlow/PyTorch/Hugging Face)
✅ DBA & Data Engineer (PostgreSQL/Redis/MongoDB)
✅ Backend Security Specialist
✅ Microservices Architect

## Test Strategy

Tests validate:
- Integrity, security, and compliance of Docker configuration files (nginx, gunicorn, supervisor, etc.)
- Robustness of scripts against real production scenarios
- Compliance with DevOps, security, and scalability standards
- Absence of security flaws, bad practices, or secret leaks
- Automated validation of file permissions, format, and integrity

Each test covers real business requirements and industrial risks. Documentation and maintenance are ensured by the above expert team.
