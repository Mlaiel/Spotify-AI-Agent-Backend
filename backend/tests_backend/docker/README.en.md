✅ Machine Learning Engineer (TensorFlow/PyTorch/Hugging Face)
✅ DBA & Data Engineer (PostgreSQL/Redis/MongoDB)
✅ Backend Security Specialist
✅ Microservices Architect

## Test Strategy

Tests validate:
- Integrity, security, and compliance of all Docker scripts and files (Dockerfile, docker-compose, healthcheck, backup, audit, etc.)
- Robustness of scripts against real production scenarios
- Compliance with DevOps, security, scalability, and observability standards
- Absence of security flaws, bad practices, or secret leaks
- Automated validation of file permissions, format, portability, and integrity

Each test covers real business requirements and industrial risks. Documentation and maintenance are ensured by the above expert team.
