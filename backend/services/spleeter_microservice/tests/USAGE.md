# Usage – Audio test resources

This folder contains only audio files and fixtures for demonstration and integration of the Spleeter microservice.

**No test scripts are present here.**

## Usage
- Place your sample audio files here (e.g. `test_audio.wav`, `test_audio.mp3`, `test_audio.flac`) for demo, benchmarks, or integration.
- Python test scripts are centralized in the main backend, never here.

## Best practices
- Never store personal or confidential data.
- Prefer open/free audio samples.
- Document each file added (origin, format, usage) in `fixtures.json`.
